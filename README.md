# Cromwell Test

### Description
Welcome to my test as part of the Cromwell application. This is a simple website involving a React front-end, a node.js API and a Postgres Database.

### How to run the application
(This tutorial assumes you have git and nodejs installed already)


Front-end:

Use a terminal to navigate to the 'cromwell-front-end' folder. If this is your first time running the app on your current device then you will need to run 'npm install' to installed the required node modules. from there you can type 'npm start' to run it.

Back-end:

Use a terminal to navigate to the 'cromwell-api' folder. If this is your first time running the app on your current device then you will need to run 'npm install' to installed the required node modules. from there you can type 'npx nodemon index' to run the back end. Don't worry about the database, the api is configured to connect to an AWS RDS Postgres instance I've already set up and am hosting for this app.
